The constraints on the colours themsevles are very small (50). Can we leverage this in some way ? 

It turns out that we can. 

Let us represent i, by 2^i. In other words, every colour is represented by a binary string in which exactly 1 bit is set.

It is clear that a segment is good if at most one character occurs an odd number of times. 

The reason we have chosen to represent the numbers as bitmasks is because it is very easy to check this with bitmasks. 

A segment [L, R] is good if XOR[L, R] has at most one bit set. 

In other words, we want to count the number of segments [L, R] where XOR[R]^XOR[L - 1] has at most one bit set. 

----

How do we count the number of such segments ?

We will keep track of the frequency of each prefix XOR. 

Suppose XOR[R]^XOR[L - 1] = 2^5, 

Then XOR[R]^(2^5) = XOR[L - 1]

So when are at i, we will check all 50 powers of 2 and check the frequency of XOR[i]^(2^p) ... This corresponds to the number of good segments so we shall add it to the answer. 

Of course XOR[0] = 1, and frequency[0] = 1 at the beginning.

Overall Time Complexity is O(T x N x C)
